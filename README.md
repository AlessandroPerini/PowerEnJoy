_Software Engineering 2 Project - Digital management system for a car-Â­sharing service_

What we want to create is a new car sharing service, called PowerEnjoy, based exclusively on
ecological electrical vehicles. So, the main scope of the project is to allow people to use the service cars for short rides around the city.
